# How to access the command-line

# Unix shell

Unix shell refers to the command-line interface of a Unix based operating system. Unix based operating systems are Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Suse, Red Hat, etc.), Mac OS and BSD distributions.

1. **Using a Unix based operating system**

If you are using an operating system that is Unix based, then you only need to open a terminal window to gain access to the shell.

Using Ubuntu you can open the terminal in the following ways:
* `Alt`+`F2` and type **gnome-terminal**
* `Control`+`Alt`+`T`
* Applications->Accessories->Terminal
* If you have a gnome environment and you have installed Guake by `F12`
    
Also you can change from the graphical interface to only command-line. First finish reading this paragraph and only then start experimenting with what you read. In the case of Ubuntu there are multiple screens that you can use. You can switch between these using key-combinations. The graphical interface can be reached by pressing `Control`+`Alt`+`F7`. Also there are 6 command-line screens: `Control`+`Alt`+`F1`, `Control`+`Alt`+`F2`, ... `Control`+`Alt`+`F6`. Just remember that on the command-line screens there is no clipboard.

2. **Using Windows**

If you are using Windows you first have to install software that emulates a Unix system or environment. Here is two ways you can do it:
* **[Running a virtual machine](doc/virtual.md)**
* **[Cygwin](doc/cygwin)**

3. **[Using server running Unix](doc/server.md)**
