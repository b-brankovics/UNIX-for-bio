# Introduction to bioinformatics

Bioinformatics is a fairly vague definition. In some sense it contains
everything that is related to biology and is done on a computer.

Like working in the lab it is a good idea to keep notes of what we do
and which protocols we use. These are crucial if we want to keep our
work reproducible.

In order to keep our notes in order, we need a format that looks
reasonably good both on graphical and command line text editors. That
is able to maintain a structure for the content and that can contain
links to files and websites, also it needs to be relatively simple to
remain readable and to make it easy for beginners to learn.

One of the most used language that is dedicated to link different
files and documents together is **HTML** (**H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup
**L**anguage). Markup languages are document types where you not only
see the text/content, but also the formatting of the content. The text
is marked up with formatting. Although, **HTML** is relatively easy to
learn and use, but typing your content can be hindered by the effort
you have to put in to properly format your text. This is the reason
why John Gruber has developed a language called **MarkDown**.

The idea behind **MarkDown** is to have a language where you have
decent control over the formatting, and the structure is apparent in a
command line editor, but keeps the formatting commands at a minimal level.
