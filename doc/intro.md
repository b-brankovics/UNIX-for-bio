# Introduction to bioinformatics

Bioinformatics is a fairly vague definition. In some sense it contains
everything that is related to biology and is done on a computer.

Like working in the lab it is a good idea to keep notes of what we do
and which protocols we use. These are crucial if we want to keep our
work reproducible.

In order to keep our notes in order, we need a format that looks
reasonably good both on graphical and command line text editors. That
is able to maintain a structure for the content and that can contain
links to files and websites, also it needs to be relatively simple to
remain readable and to make it easy for beginners to learn.

One of the most used language that is dedicated to link different
files and documents together is **HTML** (**H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup
**L**anguage). Markup languages are document types where you not only
see the text/content, but also the formatting of the content. The text
is marked up with formatting. Although, **HTML** is relatively easy to
learn and use, but typing your content can be hindered by the effort
you have to put in to properly format your text. This is the reason
why John Gruber has developed a language called **MarkDown**.

The idea behind **MarkDown** is to have a language where you have
decent control over the formatting, and the structure is apparent in a
command line editor, but keeps the formatting commands at a minimal level.
This language became very popular, because it keeps true to these
ideas. Besides the language itself there are lots of interpreter
programs that can turn this simple formatting to other document types,
such as **HTML** or **PDF**. This has become _the_ language to use
when creating documentation for software tools. One of the most
popular websites that is used to share software solutions is
**GitHub**, where you are probably reading this document.
GitHub employs a version of **MarkDown**, referred to as the ["_GitHub
Flavored Markdown_"](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/).

## Version control
After we have found the documenting language of our choice, it is a
good idea to have a way of keeping track of the changes we make to our
documents. That is what version control systems are used for. One of the
most popular system is [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/).

**Git** is the version control that is used by **GitHub** and
**BitBucket** two websites that use **MarkDown** as primary
documentation language. These are great places to store your projects,
because you can access them via the internet and you won't have
problems like forgetting where you have put your files.
