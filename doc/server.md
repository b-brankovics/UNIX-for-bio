# Using a server running Unix

### Accessing a server from a Windows computer

#### Accessing the command-line using SSH

To access the remote command-line you need to install a programme called [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).

1. Launch **PuTTY**
2. Type in the Host Name or IP address of the server
3. Hit `Open`

The command-line login should appear. Type in your username and password. You can now execute Unix commands.

#### Accessing files from the server

Accessing the files on the server to use for working with Unix tools is straight forward. However, sharing files between the server and a local Windows system requires an additional programme, [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/download.php).
