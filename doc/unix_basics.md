# Unix basics
This introduction shows some of the basic file and folder operations
on a Unix command line.

## Looking around and moving around
To see what files are located in the current working directory, we
have to use the `ls` command.

    ls

The block you see above this paragraph is a command line block. This
uses a monospace font type (every character has the same width). These
blocks show what should be typed on the command line.

The ls command will list all the files and directories that are found
in the current directory. Usually, regular files, executables and
directories are displayed in different colors by the shell (command
line interface).
